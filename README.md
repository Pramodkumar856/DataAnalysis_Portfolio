# 👋 Hi, I'm Pramod Kumar Sahoo

Welcome to my **Data & Business Analytics Portfolio**.

I’m naturally curious about data and enjoy solving real business problems using analytics. 
I like working with numbers, finding patterns, and turning complex datasets into clear insights that help teams make better decisions.

My goal is simple — **use data to help organizations understand performance, discover opportunities, and make confident data-driven decisions.**

## 💡 About Me

My journey into data analytics started with a strong interest in numbers and problem-solving. 
With a background in Physics, I developed analytical thinking and logical reasoning skills that naturally led me toward data analysis.

During my professional experience, I worked closely with business data to clean datasets, perform exploratory analysis, and build dashboards that supported real decision-making. This helped me understand how data directly impacts operational efficiency and financial performance.

I enjoy transforming messy data into simple stories that stakeholders can easily understand and act upon.
